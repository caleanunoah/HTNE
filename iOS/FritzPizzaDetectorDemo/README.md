In this app, we use the Image Labeling API by Fritz in order to build a pizza identifier similar to Domino's Points for Pies feature.

There are 2 projects to help you get started:

- Starter app - The bare bones app you should use to get started with the tutorial.
- Final app - The finished app displaying an animation when a pizza is detected.

Choose an app and run it in Xcode.

## Fritz AI

Fritz AI is the machine learning platform for iOS and Android developers. Teach your mobile apps to see, hear, sense, and think. Start with our ready-to-use feature APIs or connect and deploy your own custom models.

## Requirements

- Xcode 11.2 or later.
- Xcode project targeting iOS 10 or above. You will only be able to use features in iOS 11+, but you still can include Fritz in apps that target iOS 10+ and selectively enable for users on 11+.
- Swift projects must use Swift 4.1 or later.
- CocoaPods 1.4.0 or later.

## Getting Started

**Step 1: Create a Fritz AI Account**

[Sign up](https://app.fritz.ai/register?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=fritz-examples) for a free account on Fritz AI in order to get started.

**Step 2: Clone / Fork the fritz-examples repository and open FritzPizzaDetectorDemo (Starter or Final folder)**

```
git clone https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-examples.git
```

**Step 3: Setup the project via Cocoapods**

Install dependencies via Cocoapods by running `pod install` from `fritz-examples/iOS/FritzPizzaDetectorDemo/Starter`

```
cd fritz-examples/iOS/FritzPizzaDetectorDemo/Starter
pod install
```

- Note you may need to run `pod update` if you already have Fritz installed locally.

**Step 4: Open up a new XCode project**

XCode > Open > FritzPizzaDetectorDemo.xcworkspace

**Step 5: Run the app**

Attach a device or use an emulator to run the app. If you get the error "Please download the Fritz-Info.plist", you'll need to register the app with Fritz (See Step 2).
